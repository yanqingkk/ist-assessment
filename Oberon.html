        <p style="width: 60%">Oberon Vortigern was summoned by the planet into the British Lostbelt in
             order to destroy it, but his Saint Graph was partially corrupted into 
             "Oberon" upon his arrival by the Welsh Fairies. While in his persona as
              Oberon he is a charming man, in truth, as the King of the Mors, Vortigern
               is a Threat to Humanity who desires the destruction of both Lostbelt Britain 
               and Proper Human History.[3]

            "My name is Oberon. Oberon Vortigern. Now it's time to raise the curtain
             upon this tragedy!
            The pilgrim's journey ends here!"[3]
            
            Oberon is a Servant, as well as a doomsday device (Vortigern) brought
             into existence by the British Isle. He has appeared in various
              forms of "malice" up to now (the King of the Mors being one of them), 
              leading the British Isle to its destruction, but having been stopped 
              twice by Morgan who constructed the Queen Calendar, "Oberon" was 
              created as the third output attempt.[1]
            
            "It's disgusting how this practically dead history has survived for
             more than 10,000 years. I want to eliminate all traces of this island, 
             including everyone who lives here," he said. Nothing more than an insect 
             who was born (ended up being born) from the vomit and excretions of the 
             island's "disgust for living things."[1]
            
            Ironically, the British Isle produced the "Ancient Faerie King Oberon" 
            ( Koyōsei Oberon?), but due to Proper Human History's 
            influence infused by Morgan, his Spirit Origin ended up being overlapped 
            with "Oberon, the King of Fairies" ( Yōsei ō Oberon?).
             That is why "his purpose as a doomsday device" and "his nature as
              Oberon the King of Fairies" coexist within himself.[1]</p>

            <h3>
                Oberon
            </h3>
            <p>
                A Servant who was summoned by the land of Britain to defeat Morgan, the ruler of Faerie Britain. He is a fairy who has been around since ancient times in the British Isles, but this Oberon is heavily influenced by the fairy king from William Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer's Night DreamWP. His wife in the play, Titania, is a purely fictional creation of Shakespeare's,[4] whose inspirations were Mab, Diana, and Titan.
            <br>
            <br>
                In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Oberon is described as having great power, but his character is selfish and unmanly. He has a falling out with his queen Titania over her new changeling, and in retaliation, he creates a potion that makes a person fall in love with the first living thing they see when they wake up in order to make the changeling his. However, because of Oberon's attendant Robin Goodfellow's tendency to slack off, the potion was also given to the humans Lysander and Dimitrius...[1]
                
                There are also other stories that exist involving Oberon. In the 15th century poem Huon of BordeauxWP, he was portrayed as the king of the fairy forest and a magic user with the ability to grant all wishes.[1]
                
                He is competent in combat, but he truly excels in gathering intel and providing combat support. A hardworking person who flits around with all his might to ensure that Chaldea succeeds in their mission. He is our reliable fairy king who will do everything in his power for the right future of Britain.[1]
                <br>
                <br>
                He is popular because his appearance makes it look like he hails from the Wind Clan or the Wing Clan, clans considered elegant in the Fairy Country, but he is not actually a fairy.[1]
                
                When acting as Oberon, his Saint Graph is Ruler.

                Vortigon
            </h3>
            <p>
                His true identity is not that of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History, but a Servant who was born in Faerie Britain. A doomsday device that curses the world, born from the legend of destruction spoken of in Faerie Britain, the Insect of the Abyss that returns everything back into nothing. The name Oberon comes only from Proper Human History.[1]
            
            The physical embodiment of Faerie Britain's will to destroy itself, as it is a land that was built on the sins of fairies and should not exist. His name in Faerie Britain is Vortigern. He shares the same name as the Vile King Vortigern, who led to Britain's destruction by selling out Britain to different races in Proper Human History.[1]
            <br>
            <br>
            The Autumn Forest, located on the outskirts of the Fairy Country (Wales), is where the fairies who have been bullied and fled home as a result, and fairies who have been persecuted for simply existing and "spreading poison", come to gather and die soon after. Insect fairies with no power whatsoever. Small fairies who couldn't join the circle of fairies in the Fairy Country that mimic human society, due to their innocence and low intelligence.[1]
            
            In the midst of this forest inhabited by those who have nowhere else to go, and those who end up dying in obscurity hated and forgotten, the Vortigern of this era…Oberon was born.[1]
            
            This is the second time the planet summoned Vortigern to try and destroy the Lostbelt. The first time was 1000 years ago, when he led the Moss in a war against Morgan's army. He was defeated back then by Woodwose. As long as Cernunnos continues to exist, Vortigern cannot fully utilize his power.

                Role
            </h3>
            <p>
                Vortigern was summoned to the Lostbelt once again in the same year that Ainsel’s Prophecy gained traction. He was summoned as the Servant Oberon, but thanks to the influence of the Proper Human History brought on by Morgan’s rule, his identity was mixed with the Oberon written by William Shakespeare. When he materialized in the Forest of Wales, though, Oberon was essentially a living corpse, unable to move or even close his eyes. The Welsh fairies, who thought he was their king, swarmed on and around his body until he gained the strength to move on his own. He understood his function was to destroy Britain, though he didn’t much care for it.[8] But because of Cernunnos’ existence, he couldn’t reach his full potential. Morgan had sealed the dead god away instead of destroying it, so Oberon’s first priority was to ensure her death, to break the seal. From there, he would have someone destroy Cernunnos. Without the means to kill Morgan himself, Oberon had to wait for someone to arrive, capable of undoing the seal on Cernunnos and destroying the dead god.[9] He also used what knowledge of the Proper History he possessed to research the story of King Arthur, Morgan’s archenemy, all so he could manipulate the new Fairy of Paradise.[8]
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Leaving the forest, Oberon traveled all over Britain to learn about its current state of affairs. Through his lies, perpetrated by his knowledge of the Proper History, he convinced everyone he came across that he was a Servant from the Proper History and that his character was that of a pauper prince. He eventually discovered many fairies and humans wished to see Ainsel’s prophecy be fulfilled, particularly Morgan's dethronement. Garnering support from leaders like Aurora and Muryan, Oberon used Ainsel’s prophecy, particularly the misinterpretation the Child of Prophecy would become the new ruler, to gather fairy and human alike to form the rebellious Round Table Army, basing themselves in the ruins of Londinium. But understanding he himself has no mind for military stratagem, Oberon had Percival become Round Table’s leader.[10] Percival agreed to lead, believing overthrowing Morgan would free his sister from the queen’s servitude.
