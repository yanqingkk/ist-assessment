        <p style="width: 60%">The Lostbelt Queen who rules over Faerie Britain.

            She established an authoritarian monarchy in the Lostbelt Britain and has made the fairies suffer under her oppressive rule for 2000 years. As the highest-ranking fairy, she is a genius sorcerer who has mastered Rhongomyniad, the Lance that Shines to the Ends of the World, as a form of Magecraft.[1]
            
            Morgan was created by the planet to be the savior of Britain. When she first manifested, she was originally named Vivian. She was taken in and raised by the Rain Clan in Orkney. Her foster mother, the Rain Clan leader, called her Tonelico. The Rain Clan was massacred overnight by an alliance of the Wind, Earth, Fang, and Wing clans. They were killed for protecting the Fairy of Paradise. In fulfilling her role as savior, she used her childhood name as an alias. Her legends have continued into the Lostbelt's modern day. According to legend Tonelico has appeared again and again under different names, such as Ector the Immortal, Archduke of Residual Heat Wryneck, Grímr the Wise, and the Knight of Beginnings, Totorot. In truth, these were Tonelico's companions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Morgan was originally created by the World to force the fairies of Britain to repent and complete their duty of forging the Holy Sword via Avalon Le Fae. After being betrayed too many times during her various attempts to save Britain, Morgan decided to dominate Britain instead. In response to her failure, the planet created a new fairy, Artoria, to fulfill Morgan's old mission.
            
            Thousands of years ago, she had received the memories of her Proper Human History counterpart (who Beryl had summoned when he first arrived in the Lostbelt, and she rayshifted her memories back in time) and had used them to change the Lostbelt's history such that it would create a world for her to rule. This was the one of the causes for Morgan refusing to complete her duty to forge Excalibur, as this would mean the denial of the Lostbelt's existence and therefore the end of the Britain that she loved and wished to preserve.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the incidents Tonelico saved Britain from was the Summer War 4,000 years ago, a war between the fairies of the south and the fairies of the north led by Mab. After the end of the Summer War the fairies established the system of clans that they still use today.
            
            Morgan plans to use the magical energy of the Great Calamity to destroy proper history and turn the entire world into Faerie Britain. This will kill all the fairies outside her Camelot as well, but new fairies will always be born. She cares not for the people of Britain, only for her kingdom itself.</p>

            <h3>
                Personality
            </h3>
            <p>
                A ruthless queen who relies only on her own power. It isn't that she doesn't trust others, but rather she finds them unreliable. She sets first and foremost the "orderly rule of Britain". She hates people, fairies, the weak, the ugly, equality, peace, and is the "embodiment of evil" as perceived by the masses.

                However, "hate" does not mean "unwanted", rather it only means "incompatible with each other." For Morgan, justice is “the state of ruling” and evil is “the state of someone interfering with her rule.” Thus, Morgan's own "likes and dislikes" are irrelevant to "good and evil" as a ruler. If something is necessary to rule, she will accept and tolerate it even if she dislikes it. The extremity and authority of her standards are like those of a heartless machine.
                <br>
                <br>
                That being said, Morgan, too, has a heart. Joy, sadness, hate, anger, love, and infatuation, she just doesn't feel them as strongly as she used to anymore. After years of devoting herself to defending Britain, Morgan's heart has grown cold. The only passion that lit within her ― a wish that her past-self continued to crave.
                
                "Ruling Britain" is the only goal that continues to drive her.
                <br>
                <br>
                ...Throughout her long journey, she was reminded that this was not a human-like dream from her childhood, but that this is just how she was born.
                
                The Morgan of Proper Human History was lecherous, cruel and selfish, a true model of vice, but this Morgan has eliminated those traits and has become a talented woman who has lost her way. A frustrated beauty who is contemplative of her country. The pleasures of sex, the excitement of inflicting pain onto others, and self-absorbed joy are all "boring. I've already grown weary of those matters" so says Morgan. However, since she is only keeping low, it is possible that her former brutality and bad taste will return if she finds herself in a situation or predicament where she is pushed to the brink.[1]
                
                Morgan has adopted Baobhan Sith as her daughter, but she only ever praises her when Baobhan Sith torments the weak.[4] However, she genuinely cares for Baobhan.
                <br>
                <br>
                She secretly inherited all the memories of the Proper Human History Morgan through the machinations of the latter, and with them the knowledge that within the Lostbelt she could rewrite Britain's history so she could succeed in ruling Britain where her Proper Human History self failed. Being the ruler of Britain is her whole existence, and without it she believes that she would be worthless. Though once she used to be a kind queen ruling alongside Uther, repeated betrayals and rebellions have long since left her bitter and disillusioned. As such, she is convinced that only by ruling the Lostbelt as a tyrant can she keep Britain from being destroyed, either unaware of the fact that Britain's savior was never meant to rule Britain at all and that her kingdom could only be saved through its unmaking. or simply unwilling to accept it lest she be forced to destroy the country she loves.
                
                When summoned she regards her master as her husband/wife, a position she defines as being that of total dedication and servitude towards her. She agrees to aid Chaldea when summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru, but adds that she will always hate Proper Human History. Despite this, she eventually admits that she has become fond of Ritsuka over time and views them as her spouse in earnest.

                Role
            </h3>
            <h5>Olympus: Interstellar Mountainous City</h5>
            <p>
                Morgan fired Rhongomyniad from her location in the English Lostbelt all the way to Olympus in the Atlantic Lostbelt and destroyed Olympus's Fantasy Tree.[5]
                 <br>
                 <br>
            
                 <h5>
                    Avalon le Fae: Fae Round Table Domain
                 </h5>
                 Morgan has ruled with an iron fist for 2,000 years. She conquered Britain by defeating the six fairy clans with her black magic, uniting them by force. She granted the humans a certain degree of freedom, and over the course of 2,000 years, she created a Fairy Kingdom that was a shallow copy of human civilization. When Morgan took to the throne, she said to the fairies: "I will not tolerate you. I will not save you. Merely obey. Hang your heads. I will protect a Britain of absolute subservience."[6]
            
                 Morgan dominates the fairies and imposes strict control over the number of human births. Fairies living in cities are inscribed with Morgan's curse, the Command Spells; once a year, fairies marked with these are forced to offer their life force as an "existence tax". Fairies who fail to amass enough magical energy over the course of a year to satisfy Morgan die on the spot.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 There are a series of calamities plaguing the island ever since Britain's very creation. The Moss are said to be the first in this series, but others spring up periodically, and Morgan's knights fight them. Morgan is a cold-hearted tyrant while at the same time being a sword that protects Britain. The fairies fear and despise her, but at the same time rely on her rule.
                 
                 Beryl Gut was lying about angering the inhabitants of his Lostbelt, and it was actually all part of his and Morgan's plan to get close to Kirschtaria; so that Morgan could use Beryl as a beacon to aim Rhongomyniad at Olympus's Fantasy Tree. Beryl states that he is both Morgan's Master and husband. It is later revealed that Morgan destroyed Seyfert on her own without Beryl's knowledge, and had in fact been planning to do so from the beginning.
                 
                 Mash defends Da Vinci, Ritsuka, and Artoria from Morgan's teleportation spell called Water Mirror that was meant to be used on the Calamity of Norwich and disappears, though Beryl Gut insists she is still alive.[7][8][9][10]
