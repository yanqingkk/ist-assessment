    <h2>Worldbuiding</h2>
    <p>
        <div>
        The British Lostbelt (Buriten ibuntai?), designated Order Lostbelt No. 6 (No. 6?), is one of the seven Lostbelts appearing on the blankened Earth during the Human Order Revision incident. Originating in 12,000 BC (originally listed as 500 AD), its Lost Depth is EX, its King is Morgan, and its associated Crypter is Beryl Gut.[1][2] It is the sixth of the Lostbelts visited by Chaldea Security Organization in the undertaking of the Grand Order to restore Earth and the Human Order. Referred to as the English Lostbelt (Igirisu ibuntai?) by outsiders, the inhabitants call it the British Lostbelt and Faerie Britain ( Yōseikoku Buriten?). As of Chaldea's arrival, the form of the world is that of a Lost World rather than a Lostbelt.
The events of Chaldea's visit to this Lostbelt are covered in the sixth chapter of Cosmos in the Lostbelt; Fae Round Table Domain: Avalon le Fae (Yōsei entaku ryōiki Avaron ru Fe?), alternatively The Moment a Star Is Born ( Hoshi no umareru koku?).[1]
        </div>
        Time flows differently inside the Lostbelt than outside, as while at the Wandering Sea Chaldea was warned they only had 24 hours before the Lostbelt self-destructs and takes the outside world with it, but while within the Lostbelt they had much longer;[3] at least 50 days since that is how long the Storm Border's supplies could last, and possibly more.[4]

The Lostbelt has existed for 14,000 years.[5] The Lostbelt's true divergence point from Proper History was the absence of Excalibur, leaving Earth with no way to properly defend itself from Sefar.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Setting</h2>
<p>
    Six fairies (who would later become the founders of the fairy clans) were tasked with forging the Holy Sword, but chose not to out of sheer laziness. This resulted in Sefar succeeding in the Velber's goals by wiping out all life and landmasses of the planet, with only Avalon remaining untouched. Only the six fairies remained on surface, unable to go home to Avalon due to their sin as "Only those without sin may pass through Avalon". Thus they are left to float on the planet’s now endless ocean and suffer from the heavy waves and buffering. Then, Gaia sent Cernunnos from the Inner Sea of the Planet to properly punish them for failing their duty. But Cernunnos, being a gentle soul, did not wish to do this, feeling the fairies have been punished enough. Instead, it allowed them to live upon his body along with a human woman who was the last living human that it saved. Out of gratitude, the woman became Cernunnos’ priestess.
<br>
<br>
The fairies were ungrateful, however, and kept pestering Cernunnos to create a new home for them, something it could not do. The Priestess chastised them and warned them to reflect on their actions. Instead, the Fairies concluded that Cernunnos’ titanic body would make a nice landmass to live on. They held a celebratory feast and lied to Cernunnos about wanting to become its worshipers. They offered it a drink in their supposed gratitude. Cernunnos, thinking that they had reflected on their actions, gladly accepted the offering despite its priestess’s disbelief and suspicion. Her suspicions were proven correct as the fairies had poisoned the drink. Cernunnos died and its corpse was used as the foundation for the new Britain.
<br>
<br>
The fairies then captured the Priestess, who was the last living human. But one human would never be enough for their upcoming fairy kingdoms. Placing spells on her that leave her unable to die, they tore her into six pieces. These pieces would eventually be used to clone more humans in the future to nourish the fairy kingdoms. The humans only had a maximum life of 30 years, though, as it was the same age the Priestess was torn apart. Stuck on a dead Earth, the fairies were destined to repeatedly die, suffer, and reincarnate in an endless cycle of war and betrayal.

<h2> Plot </h2>
<p>
    Upon entering the Lostbelt, the group learns Heroic Spirits from human history cannot function properly. More precisely, human history cannot exist here. Unlike the Chinese Lostbelt, where heroes weren’t necessary, there are no heroes in this Lostbelt. For this reason, Heroic Spirits from Proper Human History cannot enter. Sherlock Holmes deduces that unlike the other Lostbelts, the English Lostbelt lacks any sign of human civilization. Ritsuka believes it’s because there are no humans. Though he concurs, Sherlocks says there are other possibilities to the lack of human civilization. Goredolf Musik questions why Mash and Leonardo da Vinci weren’t affected by the Lostbelt, unlike Sherlock and Captain Nemo. Mash suspects it’s because she is a Demi-Servant of Galahad, not the knight himself; Da Vinci suspects it is because she is technically a homunculus of the previous Da Vinci. Nemo then asks Da Vinci what happened in the last half hour. Da Vinci reveals all the Storm Border’s systems ceased to function immediately after passing through the wall of light. The Nemo engine revived a single Triton engine, though, enabling the Storm Border to crash land somewhere on the southwest coast. But it “died” upon reaching Britain’s coast without damaged or destroyed equipment. She speculates it’ll function again though if it gets further from the island. The Shadow Border can reach the shore, but it will will cease to function once it lands. Da Vinci explains the Storm Border can stay in its current state for approximately 30 days, or 50 days, if the power is further reduced. This is the time limit for the current operation. Goredolf orders Ritsuka and Mash to land on Britain in secret, investigate the cause of the “collapse” observed in Novum Chaldea, and if possible, obtain Rhongomyniad from the Lostbelt King. Since communication with the Border will be difficult, he entrusts Ritsuka and Mash to make their own decisions, and gives them 45 days to return alive with results. Da Vinci decides she’ll join Ritsuka and Mash, saying she’ll send messages to the Border via a familiar.[11]
<br>
<br>
Upon landing, Ritsuka’s party prepares to travel to a presumed city east of the shore when they’re met by Tristan. Mash senses the Round Table has a trace of heat from a summoning. This indicates to the group that Tristan is the real Tristan summoned, even though summoning Heroic Spirits should be impossible in the Lostbelt. Tristan says he was automatically summoned, having found himself before the group when he came to his senses. After the situation is explained to him, Tristan suspects he could be summoned because they’re currently in his birthplace of Cornwall. The group suspects more Heroic Spirits can be summoned if more connections to the land are established. Tristan decides to be the group’s guide, saying they’ll be on the road in two hours.[11]
<br>
<br>

The Nameless Forest

After an hour, however, the group remains lost. Tristan left strings along their path to ensure they wouldn’t get lost, but those were broken somehow. A monster then attacks the group, but it disappears without them being sure of their victory. Da Vinci noticed Ritsuka was using more magical energy than usual, and suggests avoiding battle as much as possible. Mash then suddenly collapses, noting both the Black Barrel and the Ortenaus have ceased to function. The fog then gets thicker, and everyone forgets each other’s names. Ritsuka forgets their own name, and falls unconscious. A mysterious person warns them not to say they’re human.[11]
<br>
<br>
Ritsuka later wakes up in a tent greeted by a mysterious girl who they call Mash. Assuming they were friends, “Mash” asks Ritsuka where they are, calling them by the name on their nametag (Lysander if male; Hermia if female). She only remembers collapsing in the Nameless Forest, a foggy fairy territory gradually removes the memories of those that enter it. Tristan then enters the tent, only remembering that he is Ritsuka’s servant. Ritsuka can’t remember his name, so Tristan gives them the name on his nametag: Tristram. The three believe they were traveling companions, and try to recall what they were doing and who they are. “Mash” says the village’s fairies found them. A blue-haired fairy then enters the tent, having been sent to get the group.[11]
<br>
<br>

Cornwall

In the village center, “Mash” explains to the fairies that she and the others can only remember their names. Hearing the group have nothing but their names, the fairies decide to take care of them. They then hold a festival to welcome them to Cornwall. During the festivities, “Mash” is surprised Ritsuka and Tristan don’t know about fairy society as the Nameless Forest only makes a person forget themselves. After the festival ends, the group is escorted back to their tent by the blue-haired fairy.[11]
“Mash” explains the major fairy clans of Wind, Earth, and Fang. She doesn’t know much about the Wing Clan since there isn’t much said about them. She knows the Mirror Clan was previously the most populus of the fairies until their villager vanished a few years back. Ritsuka asks her about the King Clan. Mash" calls them the cause of all discord, division, and conflict in Britain, becoming increasingly agitated as she describes the clan’s leader. After calming herself, she tells Ritsuka that they’ll understand her description of the King Clan’s leader is apt once they meet her.
<br>
<br>

The next morning, blue-haired fairy gives the group a tour of Cornwall. She explains the village is a place for fairies hated by the rest of Britain, who’d rather cooperate than fight. Following the tour, the group go into the woods to try and recall their combat skills.[11]
<br>
<br>
The morning after, the group learns from Doga that the blue-haired fairy is a nameless fairy. “Mash” explains nameless fairies are fairies who lost their name. She explains fairies are born with an innate purpose. If they lose that purpose, they lose their name, and gradually waste away to death. The other fairies ostracize fairies who’ve lost their names. “Mash” advises against inviting the nameless fairy to their tent since it would invite discourse from the other fairies. Instead, they'll find where the nameless fairy lives and remove anything dangerous nearby.[11]
<br>
<br>
The group finds where the nameless fairy lives and slays the nearby beasts. “Mash” then sets up a barrier to keep future beasts out, while Ritsuka and Tristan return to the village. After she’s done, she suggests to the nameless fairy to find a new place to live or a new purpose. The fairy rejects her suggestions, but she agrees with another suggestion of “Mash” that they both agree to keep secret. However, after “Mash” leaves, the fairy’s body starts to deteriorate.[11]

The next day, Ritsuka’s status as a human is discovered when they complain about their hunger to Harobalomia. The group is then moved to the nicest tent in the villager, where they’re brought feasts nearly every hour. However, they’re not allowed to leave, and the fairies take turns guarding the tent. “Mash” says it’s because Ritsuka is a human. She considers herself a fairy, but she was also told has human traits. She warns that Ritsuka being overindulged will get worse, as humans are an indispensable source of nourishment for fairies. But in Britain, the number of humans is tightly controlled by the Queen, so humans aren’t assigned to lower-class fairies. The fairies of the village are those who have fallen from lack of humans. The group then hears the fairies fighting each other over Ritsuka, with Doga being the first casualty. “Mash” suggests they head for the national highways in the hills to the east. The nameless fairy enters the tent to see if they’re fine. She informs them Harobalomia has been trying to calm everyone down. However, she and the others hear Onfam saying he and his fellow Earth clansmen have killed Harobalomia and rest of the Wind Clan. The nameless fairy tries to sneak the group out of the village, but they’re forced to flee when they’re heard by the Earth Clan.
<br>
<br>
Fleeing into the forest, the nameless fairy guides the group through the fog. They nearly exit the forest when the nameless fairy reveals she brought them out of into the forest so she can have them all to herself. She then transforms into Mors. “Mash” describes it as the black algae that corrupts the world with its existence; the curse of Britain and killer of fairies. The group fight it but they find themselves unable to finish it off. Instead, it is slain by a mysterious person as an act of mercy. He introduces himself as Oberon, the only Servant from the Proper History destined to help Ritsuka in the Lostbelt. Ritsuka and Tristan remember who they are, and “Mash” remembers she is Artoria.[11]

It is revealed that Mash was eaten by a Mors while she was escaping the Nameless Forest. But it spat her back out, leaving her battered and weakened. Collapsed on the roadside, she is found by fairy slavers: Rob, Wag, and Winky. Fortunately, a white wolf at her side prevents the slavers from taking her. Unfortunately, she wakes up without any of her memories. The slavers take advantage of her amnesia to convince her to get on their wagon, deciding to call her Annis. The wagon then heads north for Gloucester, with the white wolf accompanying them.[12]
