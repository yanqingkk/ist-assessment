        <h3>Profile </h3>
        <p>Also known as Artoria Caster (Arutoria Kyasutā?), 
            she is a version of Artoria Pendragon who was the "Child of Prophecy" 
            chosen by the "Staff of Selection" rather than the Sword of Selection.
             Her appearance is during the midway point in her journey of eventually 
             arriving at Camelot.[1]

            Sixteen years ago, Ainsel of the Mirror Clan foretold that in sixteen years' 
            time the Child of Prophecy would ring the six bells, overthrow the evil Queen 
            Morgan, and unite humans and fairies as King of Britain.[3] Artoria was found 
            on a boat as a baby around that time along with the Staff of Selection, 
            and raised in Tintagel by Ector knowing the staff marked her as the Child of 
            Prophecy that Ainsel spoke of. She was taught magecraft by Merlin in her 
            dreams. She is not part of any clans within the English Lostbelt. </p>

        <p>Unlike other versions of Artoria, Caster does not have the dragon 
            and king traits nor does she have the Pendragon surname, as she 
            does not have the same history as the Artoria who became King Arthur.
             She is a fairy created by the planet itself to be Lostbelt Britain's 
             savior after the previous Child of Prophecy, Tonelico, failed.]</p>

    <h3>
        History
    </h3>

<p>
    The "Child of Prophecy" that saves the Fairy Nation.
A special fairy that was dispatched from the inland sea of the star 
from Avalon to the surface along with the "Staff of Selection".
After drifting into the Lake DistrictWP, she was placed on a boat
 along with many treasures by the decision of the Chief of the Mirror
  Clan, eventually reaching the coast of Tintagel and being raised as
   a fairy of Tintagel from then on.[2]

In the Lostbelt, she is the same being as the "someone" who was eventually 
burdened with the holy sword in Proper Human History.
Also, an "accumulation device" sent to collect information on the surface, 
in order to produce the holy sword - a decisive weapon against the "threat 
to the star".[2]
<br>
<br>
Since she is not a fairy originated from the Fairy Nation Britain, the 
fairies from Britain have an instinctive antipathy against her.
Conversely, for fairies who hate all fairies from Britain, fairies not 
born in the Six Clans and fairies who hate themselves to begin with, the 
"fairy of paradise" is a source of solace.[2]
<br>
<br>
Artoria Caster fulfilled her duties in the Fairy Nation and vanished.
Afterwards, having consecrated her body to the holy sword and turned 
into the holy sword itself, she became an anthropic principle auxiliary 
device that aids "those who oppose a threat that endangers the star".
Its name is Artoria Avalon.
Her appearance in the Third Ascension is actually the proper figure of 
the one summoned here. What we see in the First and Second Ascension is 
but an emulation of the way of being of a "departed someone", which created 
her not the memories as a fairy of paradise, but the memories of spring 
from when she travelled as a Child of Prophecy.[2]

<h3>
    Personality
</h3>
<p>
    An innocent and very energetic girl. Artoria has the figure of a perfectly 
    commonplace girl who hates to lose, is strong in the face of criticism and
     adversity, values the surrounding atmosphere more than anything else, and 
     hides her true feelings from everyone.
     <br>
     <br>

This Artoria was summoned to Chaldea earlier. Her relationship with the Master
 is said to be more along the lines of "a fellow friend one can rely on" rather 
 than say "a hero and a mage".

Staring in wonder when looking at the King of Knights Artoria, becoming depressed 
when looking at the Artoria who became a tyrant, and happily smiling while saying 
"That looks nice!" from the bottom of her heart when looking at the swimsuit Artoria; 
such is this Artoria.[1]

She knows her destiny but is afraid to face it and wishes that she was not the Child
 of Prophecy. Feeling unworthy of and not wanting such a lofty title, she does her 
 best to hide her true identity, but she gets noticeably nervous whenever someone asks
  about the Child of Prophecy’s identity. When people do find out about her true identity, they usually react with doubt and surprise since she is initially weaker than the average fairy. Artoria, for her part, just wants to be considered a normal girl. She is aware that most people only to support her in fulfilling her destiny for their own self-serving ends and their self-preservation. But she also knows when people want to genuinely support her, even accepting worthless junk given as gifts because she can see the gratitude in their eyes.
