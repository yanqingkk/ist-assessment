        <p style="width: 60%">Artoria Caster is a version of Artoria Pendragon who was the "Child of Prophecy" chosen by the "Staff of Selection" rather than the Sword of Selection. Her appearance is during the midway point in her journey of eventually arriving at Camelot.[1]

            Sixteen years ago, Ainsel of the Mirror Clan foretold that in sixteen years' time the Child of Prophecy would ring the six bells, overthrow the evil Queen Morgan, and unite humans and fairies as King of Britain.[4] Artoria was found on a boat as a baby around that time along with the Staff of Selection, and raised in Tintagel by Ector knowing the staff marked her as the Child of Prophecy that Ainsel spoke of. She was taught magecraft by Merlin in her dreams. She is not part of any clans within the English Lostbelt.
            
            Unlike other versions of Artoria, Caster does not have the dragon and king traits nor does she have the Pendragon surname, as she does not have the same history as the Artoria who became King Arthur. She is a fairy created by the planet itself to be Lostbelt Britain's savior after the previous Child of Prophecy, Tonelico, failed.</p>

            <h3>
                History
            </h3>
            <p>
                The "Child of Prophecy" that saves the Fairy Nation. A special fairy that was dispatched from the inland sea of the star... from Avalon to the surface along with the "Staff of Selection". After drifting into the Lake DistrictWP, she was placed on a boat along with many treasures by the decision of the Chief of the Mirror Clan, eventually reaching the coast of Tintagel and being raised as a fairy of Tintagel from then on.[2]

In the Lostbelt, she is the same being as the "someone" who was eventually burdened with the holy sword in Proper Human History. Also, an "accumulation device" sent to collect information on the surface, in order to produce the holy sword - a decisive weapon against the "Threat to the Planet".[2]
<br>
<br>
Since she is not a fairy originated from the Fairy Nation Britain, the fairies from Britain have an instinctive antipathy against her. Conversely, for fairies who hate all fairies from Britain, fairies not born in the Six Clans and fairies who hate themselves to begin with, the "fairy of paradise" is a source of solace.[2]

Artoria Caster fulfilled her duties in the Fairy Nation and vanished. Afterwards, having consecrated her body to the holy sword and turned into the holy sword itself, she became an anthropic principle auxiliary device that aids "those who oppose a threat that endangers the star". Its name is Artoria Avalon.

            <h3>
                Personality
            </h3>
            <p>
                An innocent and very energetic girl. Artoria has the figure of a perfectly commonplace girl who hates to lose, is strong in the face of criticism and adversity, values the surrounding atmosphere more than anything else, and hides her true feelings from everyone.

This Artoria was summoned to Chaldea earlier. Her relationship with the Master is said to be more along the lines of "a fellow friend one can rely on" rather than say "a hero and a mage".
<br>
<br>
Staring in wonder when looking at the King of Knights Artoria, becoming depressed when looking at the Artoria who became a tyrant, and happily smiling while saying "That looks nice!" from the bottom of her heart when looking at the swimsuit Artoria; such is this Artoria.[1]

She knows her destiny but is afraid to face it and wishes that she was not the Child of Prophecy. Feeling unworthy of and not wanting such a lofty title, she does her best to hide her true identity, but she gets noticeably nervous whenever someone asks about the Child of Prophecy’s identity. When people do find out about her true identity, they usually react with doubt and surprise since she is initially weaker than the average fairy. Artoria, for her part, just wants to be considered a normal girl. She is aware that most people only to support her in fulfilling her destiny for their own self-serving ends and their self-preservation. But she also knows when people want to genuinely support her, even accepting worthless junk given as gifts because she can see the gratitude in their eyes.

Her pessimism about her destiny and inferiority complex resulted from her treatment by the people of Tintagel. For sixteen years, she endured as they forced their expectations on her while abusing for being a burden. The only person who cared for her was Ector. Yet despite her mistreatment, Artoria was left severely traumatized when the Fang Clan razed Tintagel to the ground. Any scene that reminds her of that trauma causes Artoria to be consumed by rage and hatred towards the perpetrators. In general, she refuses to confront her past even when forced to.
<br>
<br>    
In truth, she doesn’t care about saving Britain, and deceives herself to fulfill her duty to meet others’ expectations. Instead, she fights for the sake of humans and fairies for a currently undisclosed reason. She also fears having nowhere to go once her duty is fulfilled. But she will grow to see all lives on the planet as the same and vows to protect them, regardless if they’re from the Proper Human History, Singularities, or Lostbelts.

The Artoria from Proper Human History had a straightforward personality, but the Artoria from the Lostbelt is not that strong. In the inside, she is a pessimist with extremely frail and timid disposition.

In her heart, she lets out a sigh while thinking that both herself as a "Child of Prophecy" and the surrounding people that self-destruct as they place their expectations on such a thing are foolish.

            <h3>
                Role
            </h3>
            <p>
                Tired of the ridicule, the lies, and her mission, Artoria went to the Nameless Forest, hoping its fog will make her forget everything. However, as a Fairy of Paradise, she is immune to such effects. But she still refused to accept her role, and thus pretended that she lost her memories. As a result, she became resident of Cornwall.  
            <br>
            <br>
            
            She later meets Ritsuka when they wake up in the tent shared by those who lost their memories to the Nameless Forest. Ritsuka calls her Mash, which Artoria goes along with to maintain the lie that she also lost her memories. She then asks Ritsuka where they are, calling them by the name on their nametag (Lysander if male; Hermia if female). She lies that she only remembers collapsing in the Nameless Forest. Tristan then enters the tent, only remembering that he is Ritsuka’s servant. Ritsuka can’t remember his name, so Tristan gives them the name on his nametag: Tristram. The three believe they were traveling companions, and try to recall what they were doing and who they are. Artoria says the village’s fairies found them.
